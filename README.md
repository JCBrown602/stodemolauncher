A copy of STO Demo Launcher (SDL) copied from Sourceforge on 01 AUG 2019. The [Sorceforge version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/stodemolauncher/) shows its last update as 13 DEC 2017 and the author/maintainer as 'rachelgarrett', as in [Capt. Rachel Garrett](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel_Garrett) I suspect. There is also a 'captneo' listed as a contributor. As far as I can tell, they created this project so I want to preserve that history here. However, I've decided to keep the version number the same to emphasize that it is the same project, just in a different location (the fourth zero has been omitted and the versions here will follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format). My goal is to provide a means for requesting features as well as stockpiling all available guides and tutorials into this projects wiki page here on GitHub.

### So what is STO Demo Launcher (SDL)?
The creators original definition:
> The Star Trek Online Demo Launcher will help you to inspect, manage, and run your demo files recorded in "Star Trek Online". This tool is not endorsed or supported by Cryptic Studios or Atari.

Basically, the SDL is a way to take great screenshots and create machinima videos using 'demo' files created while playing the MMORPG Star Trek Online. Demo files are created in-game using what is surely a relatively unknown slash command, /demorecord. A pretty good introduction to the SDL, written by the creator herself, Rachel, can be found here: [StarbaseUGC](http://starbaseugc.com/index.php/sto-ugc-tutorial/sto-demo-launcher-2-0/). The post is from February, 2011, but it's surprisingly still applicable. I'll be going through it more thoroughly to make any needed updates and adding it here for completeness/posterity.

### Why move it here / reinvent the wheel?
A large portion of my reasoning behind making a copy of the SDL project here is purely self-serving. I love the project and want to know all of the in's and out's and I'm not very familiar with how Sourceforge works (SVN vs DVCS(Git)). I'm much more familiar with Git and Github's site seems a lot better for bringing out the best in the SDL if for no other reason than the awesome community here. 

The other part of it is that the SDL is in C#. I need to learn a lot more C# and I was looking for a cool, functioning project that I could really dive into and examine. 

Finally, there are very few good tutorials out there on how to use this thing. When talking about what the SDL is actually capable of, I've only found one YouTuber who seemed to have a good handle on its capabilities. I would like to make the SDL more accessible and easier to use so more people can make great Star Trek Online machinima.

### More to follow...
I hope to steadily compile all the information I can find about how to use the SDL and this readme will surely change as things start to take shape here at its new home. In the meantime, message me and/or click the "Watch" and "Star" buttons at the top right area of the page.
